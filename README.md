- DeFi owes its existence to the launch of the Ethereum blockchain in 2015 and the rise of smart contracts.
- Some DeFi protocols, such as MakerDAO, were in development as early as 2014.
- Decentralized exchanges like EtherDelta emerged in 2017 alongside ICOs.
- Compound launched in 2018, setting the stage for new approaches to protocol governance and new incentive systems with the release of the COMP token in 2020.
- DeFi saw some of its earliest stress tests with the start of the pandemic in 2020, as values plunged.
- In the last two to three years, new protocols have continued to launch, particularly on non-Ethereum blockchains.

A decentralized exchange uses (automatically-executed protocols) to facilitate trading between individuals, but doesn’t take control of their coins.

DEXs handle this in one of three ways: an on-chain order book, an off-chain order book, or an automated market maker approach.

**A decentralized exchange facilitates trading between individuals, but doesn’t take control of their coins.**

With off-chain order books, all of this happens elsewhere, with only the final transaction settled on the blockchain. Since orders aren’t stored on-chain, this method can run into some of the security issues of centralized exchanges but isn’t as slow or costly as on-chain order books.

Automated market makers, or AMMs, forego order books. With order books, if you have [Chainlink](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-chainlink) tokens and want to buy [Compound](https://decrypt.co/resources/compound-defi-ethereum-explained-guide-how-to), you’d need to have someone with Compound who wants Chainlink and is willing to trade at an agreed-upon price. AMMs remove counter-parties and introduce algorithms to set the price, letting you trade Chainlink for Compound regardless of whether there’s someone on the other end of the trade. To facilitate this, they typically use “liquidity pools,” essentially paying users to keep some of their funds in a smart contract that can then be tapped for trades. Individual users, therefore, play a key role in facilitating trades.

disadvatanges:

- DEXs allow trading without an intermediary.
- Users don't need to give up custody of their coins.
- The main drawback for some: you're responsible for your own security.

Liquidity pools are crowdsourced crypto locked in a smart contract, which supply crypto into DeFi markets. The world of finance runs on liquidity. Without available funds, financial systems grind to a halt. [DeFi, or decentralized finance](https://decrypt.co/resources/defi-ultimate-beginners-guide-decentralized-finance)—a catch-all term for financial services and products on the blockchain—is no different.

Liquidity pools are smart contracts containing locked crypto tokens that have been supplied by the platform's users. They’re self-executing and don’t need intermediaries to make them work. They are supported by other pieces of code, such as automated market makers (AMMs), which help maintain the balance in liquidity pools through mathematical formulas.

liquidity is just like stock in the store , for someone to buy item , the item must be in the store 

Same as the market in vendors happen , more people buy , lesser the product gets in quantity, higher goes the demand and price of that product

Often slippage occurs if there is very low liquidty . Slippage—a large difference between the expected price of a token trade and the price at which it is actually executed

total value locked; investors make more money due to liquidity due to incentive structure 

Liquid pools are risky . Biggest users of liquidity pools are : Aave, uniswap, 1inch ;all these are decentralized exchanges

How is liquidity added ? : we need equal amounts of tokens , just to balance or “zap” :adding liquidity in one transaction using apps like zapper 

farmers who provide liquidity to a pool on the launc day exit the pool within 24hrs . this is aproblem , to overcome this instead of setting up a liquidity pool, the protocol lets users sell their crypto into its treasury in exchange for its discounted protocol token, OHM

- Liquidity pools are crowdsourced crypto locked in a smart contract.
- Liquidity in DeFi is typically expressed in terms of “total value locked,” which measures how much crypto is entrusted into protocols.
- Low liquidity leads to high slippage—a large difference between the expected price of a token trade and the price at which it is actually executed.

Yield farming:

lending crypto that is stagnant in a wallet or an exchange using defi protocols locked in a smart contract

YF on ethereum is done using ERC-20 tokens 

how does yf work? : here first funds are added to liquidity pools ie smart contracts that contain funds .this pool powers a selling place where users can buy/sell/exchange tokens . For locking up funds in pool you’ll be awarded some money . For example if you lend out arb on a  exchange like aave . Aave can be also said as decentralized non custodial money market protocol . Most of people move their funds oftenly in favor of the return around the defi apps

1 . Liquidity providers deposit funds into a liquidity pool.

2 . Deposited funds are normally [stablecoins](https://decrypt.co/resources/stablecoins) linked to USD, such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and more.

3  . Another incentive to add funds to a pool could be to accumulate a token that’s not on the open market, or has low volume, by providing liquidity to a pool that rewards it.

4 . Your returns are based on the amount you invest, and the rules that the protocol is based on.

5 . You can create complex chains of investments by reinvesting your reward tokens into other liquidity pools, which in turn provide different reward tokens.

Click in this YF: you show up early you reap the most haha

The only problem is risk , ie its all  volatile . Still this YF is important 

flash farms are those yf which just comes up in a weak and vanishes in a week

AAVE :value locked into smart contracts is Aave is the largest project till date 

YEARN.FINANCE: helps in moving users funds and getting them best deals

COMPOUND: allows people to earn money on crypto they save

YF has caused high gas fees on eth network 

How COMPOUND works  : 

borrowing funds  from compound gives you COMMP tokens in return . If the cashback is worth more than the cost of borrowing fees we can continue to borrow funds and get cashback rewards . we can lend the highest intrest rate item, borrow as much as we can against the token and later return the remaining item to pool . In simple words you make a deposit in a exchange and then borrow against the deposit you made .

They dont last for long time , just quick bucks , some have also called scems which are flash farming projects 

- With yield farming, cryptocurrency that would otherwise be sitting in an exchange or in a wallet is lent out via DeFi protocols ie used for good
- Interest rates can be volatile and it is QUITE RISKY bro
- The first step in yield farming involves adding funds to a liquidity pool, which are essentially smart contracts that contain funds.
